Our Group Name: Koala-ty Data Team

What neighborhoods in San Diego, CA whine/complain the most?

Data Used: San Diego 311 calls, Census Data, Google Maps, Zillow

Methods Used to Analyze: Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib; Tableau: visualization

Presentation: Used PowerPoint to communicate the analysis to an audience of 30 people.

Overview: The review encompassed a storyline of Mark who is moving from New York to California and did not want to live in a neighborhood
where the neighbors complain, also wanted to live close to Balboa Park in a relatively inexpensive nice neighborhood.
Mark made his decision based on the data presented based on the median average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in a 3 mile radius of Balboa
Park, 311 call types, education, income and age based on each neighborhood.

Review the PDF presentation of the PowerPoint to find out where Mark chose to live.

This project was completed with a total of 4 members. We chose our own topic to evaluate.

My primary role: data cleaning and data visualizations. Pulled Zillow data for project.
